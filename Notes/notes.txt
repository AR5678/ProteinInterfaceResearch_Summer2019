 protiens to run on predus

  1AK4.A
  1AVX.A
  1BGX.H
  1DFG.E

68

awk '!seen[$1]++'


  september: Goals
    1) predus 241
    2) combined ROC curves- go through and make sure it makes sense clean up maybe use perl
    3)


1) devide the files based on each data set, split betweeen nox and benchmrak, makecsv prediction file for each.
2) train 2 regresions with 100 percent training on each, use logit funciton to obtain P value for protiens in otehr data set.
3) save as csv send to mordichia
4) muliple combintaions of predictions methods
5) find p and aic value for each regresion
